# first-time
It's the first lab in **sec math 17** so, *if nothing goes right, go left*. 
This is the [first-time](https://www.example.com)


this is how we set up RStudio

1. installed r from the [R](www.r-project.com) website.
2. installed RStudio from their website
hope that ==all things went right so i wont go left==
